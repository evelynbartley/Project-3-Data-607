## Introduction

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RPost)
```

## Data overview:

This report is based on a survey of 89,184 software developers from 185 countries around the world. This is the number of responses we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on consenting to share their information in this survey and finishing all the required questions; approximately 2,000 responses were not included in this analysis. The survey was fielded from May 8, 2023 to May 19, 2023.

```{r load-data}
#Load the original .csv file from Stack Overflow
survey_2023 <- read.csv("https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/alexandersimon1/Data607/main/Project3/survey_results_public.csv", header = TRUE)
```

### Database Design

This is the ER Diagram of our SQL database:

## Data Tidying

This data will be tidied in R, pushed to pre-made relational tables in PostgreSQL, and then analyzed through R.

### Assign IDs to Unique Values

```{r find-unqiue-values}

```

```{r push to postgreSQL tables}

```
